this repository includes two custom allocators
    - pool
    - arena

It has a custom opengl batch renderer

uses a command queue to draw signed-distance field shapes
- rectangles
- font glyph
- triangles
- bezier curves
- images

I use signed-distance fields for all these shapes for easy outlines and rounded corners.

It also features an auto layout immediate mode GUI.
